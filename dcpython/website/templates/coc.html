DC Python is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free
community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any
community member in any form. This does not only extend to members to
local DC Python communities, but to anyone who chooses to become
involved in the larger DC Python community of users, developers and
integrators through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to
personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public
or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks, Slack or IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or
other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual
attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior
are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the
community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender, expulsion from any DC Python event, or expulsion
from mailing lists, chats, discussion boards and other electronic
communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion
from DC Python Meetup group membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from
any member of the DC Python community, Slack or IRC chat admins, website
admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on
under the auspices of DC Python. You may also email conduct@dcpython.org
to report harassment or other violations of this policy. If the person
who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from
handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the
right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without
response.
